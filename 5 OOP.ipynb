    "# Python Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. Overview of OOP terminology:\n",
    "* Class − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "* Class variable − A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
    "* Data member − A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
    "* Function overloading − The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
    "* Instance variable − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "* Inheritance − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "* Instance − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
    "* Instantiation − The creation of an instance of a class.\n",
    "* Method − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
    "* Object − A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n",
    "* Operator overloading − The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if a class variable is set using an object, the value of the class variable is changed only for that particular object and the class variable is replaced with the object variable."

    "# Tasks\n",
    "1. Create a class \"BankAccount\". The class constructor has to accept two parameters: \"name\" - account holder's name and \"balance\" - account balance. Create a class method \"add_transaction\" which accept amount of money to be debited / added to the current account balance. Create a \"current_balance\" method to return the current account balance. \n",
    "2. Supplement the first task class with the ability to store all transactions. Also create a \"show_transactions\" method that prints all the transactions on the account. \n",
    "3. Supplement the first task class with the static method \"is_balance_positive\", which accept current balance and would return True if the balance is positive and False if negative. \n",
    "4. Supplement the first task class with the class method \"create_multiple\", which will accept list with names and surnames, and would return a list of accounts with zero balances.\n",
    "5. Create an Address Book application. Use two classes: \n",
    "    * \"Contact\" - which describes the contact made up of attributes: first name, last name, phone number, email address, workplace.\n",
    "    * \"AddressBook\" - where all your contacts are stored. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   The following functions must be implemented: creating, editing, deleting contacts, searching for a contact by name, surname and starting the phone number. A method is needed to derive the number of contacts. It also requires a nice display of the contact and address book on the screen, with the ability to sort by name or surname. \n",

    "   1. Create a contact (enter name, surname, phone number, email, workplace)\n",
    "   2. Edit a contact (enter contact for editing, enter new name, surname, phone number, email, workplace)\n",
    "   3. Remove a contact (enter contact for removing)\n",
    "   4. Number of contacts in AddressBook\n",
    "   5. Search contact by:\n",
    "       1. Name\n",
    "       2. Surname\n",
    "       3. Phone number\n",
